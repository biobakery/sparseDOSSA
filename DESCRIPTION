Description: The package is to provide a model based Bayesian method to
    characterize and simulate microbiome data. sparseDOSSA's model captures the
    marginal distribution of each microbial feature as a truncated,
    zero-inflated log-normal distribution, with parameters distributed as a
    parent log-normal distribution. The model can be effectively fit to
    reference microbial datasets in order to parameterize their microbes and
    communities, or to simulate synthetic datasets of similar population
    structure. Most importantly, it allows users to include both known
    feature-feature and feature-metadata correlation structures and thus
    provides a gold standard to enable benchmarking of statistical methods for
    metagenomic data analysis.
